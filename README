This is a new SOA framework for the CloudProjetAcademy to support various applications.

This framework uses Maven for the build process. Below are the various modules and their definitions:

mvc - This module will have all the web tier classes (Controllers, JSP's, Scripts, Styles etc)

domain - This module will have all the POJO classes for each tables in the database. The 'mvc' layer creates the domain classes and pass it to the Service/Persistence layer.

service - This module will have all the ServiceImpl (app) classes which will have all the business logic. The service layer will talk to database via persistence layer.

persistence - This module will have all the persistence manager impl classes which uses the Hibernate + JPA + Native Queries to get the data from database.

core - This module will have all the core common classes which are used by other modules.

maven - This module will have all the pom files needed to build the complete project (See more details on the Maven structure & deliverables on CPacademy Wiki page).
